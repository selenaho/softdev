	<h2>TNPG: Go Jose!</h2>
	<h2>Gordon Mo, Joshua Liu, Selena Ho</h2>
	<h3>Hello your username is {{username}}!</h3>
	<p>The request method we used was {{Method}}</p>
	<p><b>GET:</b> 
		GET is mainly for retrieving data, like when opening a Google doc. 
		GET should be used for smaller pieces of data because it's passed in the url.
	</p>
	<p><b>POST:</b> 
		In order to get data back with POST, data has to be sent to the server in order to get it back (like how we submitted a username before displaying it in the response page).
		POST is used for modifying data, like modifying a Google doc.
