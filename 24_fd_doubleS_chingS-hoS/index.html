                <p>One frightful Thanksgiving, Soy was suddenly approached by a group of terrifyingly large humans. They were coming after him with butcher's knives. Apparently, it was tradition to cook turkeys but Soy was the only bird alive in the area so they settled for him. Soy managed to run away and now refuses to leave his little duck abode every Thanksgiving.</p>

                <p> Deno was the best dino baller on the court, he had the nicest lay-up package, fastest release, and smoothest handles. One thing he didn't have was the new green cashmere hat that would match his green cashmere scarf. He treked long and far for the green cashmere hat, but to no avail. On his way back from practicing at his local planet fitness basketball gym, he finally saw the hat on top of a roller coaster, he used his hops and jumped on top of the and got the hat. </p>
