# DISCO:
- callout: puts a border around the element
- cell is like a grouping of an element?
- grid-x formats things into grids
- grid-margin-x puts a margin between the elements of the grid
- medium-up-number puts number elements in one row of the grid
- according to foundation documentation: "Small grids expand to large screens easier than large grids cram into small screens." (for small-number vs medium-number vs large-number)
- according to foundation documentation: "To define cell widths within a direction-level, instead of the individual cell level, add the class .[size]-up-[n] to a grid-x, where [n] is the number of cells to display per direction, and [size] is the breakpoint at which to apply the effect."
- .[size]-[n] is just the size of the element (ex: .large-3 takes up 3 columns out of the 12)
- difference between small, medium, large is the breakpoints (ex: including class="small-up-2 medium-up-4 large-up-6" will make the grid so that there's six elements in one row with a large screen, four in one row with a medium screen, and two in one row with a small screen) 
- float grids in foundation have 12 columns 
- .[size]-[n] is applied to the elements of the grid but .[size]-up-[n] is applied to the div containing the elements of the grid (?)
- xy grids are the grids with grid-x, cells, .[size]-[n] and float grids are the ones with columns within a row
