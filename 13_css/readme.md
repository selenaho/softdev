## DISCO:
CSS layout is mostly base on the box model. 
- Padding is the space around the content.
- Margin is the space outside of the border. 

The DIV tag is used to group elements.
- Class attribute can be used for multiple elements
- ID attribute only for one. 

Colors can be in hexadecimal or common colors referenced by name.

## QCC: 
When should you use in-style vs internal vs external styling?
